Sankage's Tech Library
======================

This is a listing of books (dead tree) I own that relate to Programming and Development.

## Organization

The books are organized by language/category in YAML files named after their respective groupings.

## Location

Each book will have a location key that can have one of the following values: `home`, `transit`, `work`. A book in `transit` is currently in my bag and so is located whereever I am.
